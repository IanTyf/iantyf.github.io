							This project went through 9 iterations, some with completely different directions. Being a thesis project of four, we all agreed to contribute equally to the design and creative directions, which while making everything four times harder to agree on, has taught us how to work effectively and productively as a group of designers and developers. The importance of setting clear creative challenges and design pillars that we can always refer to as well as almost aggressively playtesting and iterating really came through and has formed the basis of this game's development cycle.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since we set out to create more of an experience and a series of delightful moments, a lot of our design challenges revolved around setting expectations for players. We would often get playtest feedback that starts with misunderstandings of the game's intention, such as "how can I make him character happy", when the player is intended to embody and play as the character, and "how many puzzles are left", when the game really isn't about being a hardcore puzzle game, but rather a series of interactions to experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							Part of dealing with this comes down to clearly communicating the game's intention, which we've done a lot through visual storytelling. For example, by switching to a first-person perspective and adding thought bubbles, as well as normalizing the emotions that the 2D character shows in response to player input, we've managed to inform the player that they're the child and their actions are controlling the child's imagination, without being explicit about it using text.
						</p>
						<p>
							But the other part, and arguably more interesting part of it is trying to meet player expectations when they make sense. While we've made numerous attempts to "de-puzzle-lize" the game and make it a more relaxing experience, ultimately we realized that our core experience, which is the delightful "aha!" moments from putting sketches to the right place with the right order, wouldn't be as fun without the little bit of time and struggle beforehand. That has then led to our development and iterations of our "hint" system, which is done through a narrative approach where if the player is stuck, the player character would talk about how they feel about the sketch he's holding, which serves as an indirect clue to the player. This is intended to help with making the mental connection between the sketches and the 3D environment, without breaking the immersion and "puzzle-lize" the game, and on top of that we also have a more gamey and magical aid that indicates if the player is close by transforming the sketches to look more like the target object.

							<p>Thanks to our previous prototypes, going into production we had a clear idea of what our workflow could look like. That allowed us to think ahead and build tools to optimize it.</p>
							<p>
								Since we're working with multiple 2D animations interacting with each other at different timings, which results in lots of branching, it's important for us to be able to preview the interaction as the artists work on the drawings. While in drawing softwares it's possible to do with layers, Unity doesn't actually allow previewing multiple animations in the scene view. It would be a great hassle if artists need to ask help from programmers to implement the animations every single time if they want to try something and then adjust based on how it looks in-game.
							</p>
							<img src="imgs/multianim_1.png">
							<p>
								So I made an editor window that takes unlimited gameobjects and each with a corresponding animation clip. Artists can then play and preview all the animations in the scene view or compare timings by dragging the sliders or entering the exact frame number. It works seamlessly with Unity's built-in animator component so they can adjust the curves and key frames on the side and immediately see the results.
							</p>
							<p>
								The other part that's worth mentioning is the code structure of the project. Since the functionalities of the sketches on the sketchbook are all the same, they all share the same draggableUI script with easy-to-read settings. But because each animation behaves differently, we need to implement each one with their own behavior script. I wrote an Anim parent script that handles all the triggering and universal behaviors such as hiding/showing corresponding 3D objects, appear/disappear events, etc, and contains all the necessary reference fields. This way our programmers can focus just on the specific animation behaviors and not worry about anything else.
							</p>
							<img src="imgs/limejuice_5.png">
							<p>
								Lastly, inspired by many PC port of big console titles, we added controller support that seamlessly transitions from the mouse cursor to the controller cursor, using Unity's new input system and a virtual mouse.

							Inputs are weird. While I find alt-controls crazy clever and beautiful, everytime i think about them it just reminds me of how there is still so much we haven't explored with our typical day-to-day good old mouse and keyboard. I want there to be more thought put into reconsidering our typical approach to interacting with these devices, and this is one of the first attempts.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's intended to be a sarcastic/exhibition-y game where it's short and funny, but leaves players thinking about them at least for a short bit afterwards. I went for this extreme approach where I want the game to almost hurt the players a little bit, and some of the earlier ideas included stretching fingers and rubbing keys in certain impossible ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							But the prompt "sink or swim" got me thinking about swimming, and sports in general. While it's a no-brainer that sports are games instead of the other way around, the debate between traditional sports and esports is a lot more interesting and worth thinking about. the classic "if i tell you the move and you move the pieces, who is playing chess" argument is so strong that to me the distinction seems inevitable, but from an anti-categorical thinking perspective it made me want to try and make something that sits comfortably in between: a digital game where you look at screens and use keyboards but everything else is plain physical.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything else that came afterwards are pretty straightforward designs, where the competitiveness is introduced because the game needs a funny and fast-paced gameplay to contrast with the rough input, and it's done through competitive multiplayer. I chose tug of war instead of other options like racing because it's generally a lot easier to scale and I want to keep the game about being physically superior, and things like racing can be a lot more nuanced. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Right before the exhibition at GDC 2023 I added a few more quality of life changes, which raised surprisingly interesting topics that I hadn't thought of before.
						</p>
						<p>
							I started thinking about playernames in games. in the exhibition since everyone will be looking at one screen, it's natural to allow players to name their little guys so that they don't get confused. but then it hit me that even just by asking the player to enter a name it's influencing quite a lot. some players might be bad at coming up with a name; most players don't want to use their real names; sometimes in rpg games it might pull them out of the immersion when other characters refer to them by the fake name they give to the main character, etc etc. whereas on the other hand the letters themselves often times doesn't really do anything. If we want to connect the player with the player character there is so much more we can do, and if I want the player to be able to tell who's who there are so many different ways to achieve that. naming just feels like a fake empowering process that is under-designed.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is then unfortunately a part that I didn't get to discuss since I had little time making adjustments before the exhibition. I ended up adding a tiny detail where if the player is typing their name, the character also changes color based on the most recent letter they typed. So if they want to be referred to by a particular name, they'll have to live with the player color that comes with it, or else they need to find a different name that gives them a color they enjoy playing as. it totally didn't come through in the exhibition and is something i'll keep thinking about in the future.

						<p>
							It was my first attempt at putting out a multiplayer game for others to play, and I chose to give Unity Fish-Net a try. The api was pretty easy to pick up and most of my thoughts went into how to design the networking structure. originally the game only supported a traditional two-way tug of war, so the most straightforward way was to sync up one single rope object and child all the characters under it. The rope would be server-authoritative and with position lerping the game would look smooth enough.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, I wanted to support a three-way tug of war mostly for the exhibition, in case a larger group of people came by. This seemingly simple addition made it so that I had to separate out each player, the rope that connects to the center, and the center object that is being pulled around. the intuitive way would be to make the player movement client-authoritative, but since it's fast-paced and i care more about synchronization between screens than control responsiveness for this exhibition prototype, i decided to keep all the calculation server-side and it would send out the position and direction based on some physics calculation at a fixed tick-rate.
						</p>
						<p>
							The swimming motion detection was actually pretty easy, as I simply separated out the keys on the left and right side of the keyboard, and assigned each of them a position in 2d coordinates. then i'll be able to keep track of a history of key presses and check the general direction they're going, and whether it meets the breaststroke motion i'm intending them to perform.
						</p>

							A related topic that came up was with keyboard ghosting, which is a hardware limitation that many of my other prototypes faced. I had to modify the swimming motion detection logic to ignore empty inputs, but even then I can't really prevent keyboards with no ghosting from out-performing keyboards that have ghosting. luckily, the game is by design an anti-gamer game since it's impossible to consistently rub your hands against mechanical keyboard, so it wasn't too bad in this particular case.

						<p>
							The second hand is a puzzle adventure game where the player tries to rewrite a story through manipulating time. The player plays as the spirit of the former owner of this antique clock shop, and gets to possess all the clocks in the shop and manipulate both the display time on each clock and the actual time in the world. The player gets to experience the story through multiple angles from different clocks, and use his limited abilities on the clocks to affect how the story unfolds.

						<p class="myRole">
							Ian works on designing the core time manipulation mechanic, as well as the implementation of all the systems, including branching narrative and controller input.

						<p>
							Usually puzzle games are punishing - if you can't solve it then you either find hints or be stuck forever. We wanted to create a narrative puzzle experience where, even if the player doesn't take any action and be a spectator, the story still unfolds. In the meantime, we then empower players with interactions that can alter how the story goes. As a clock, the player is able to do typical actions like ringing and moving the clock hand, which has an impact on how the story goes (eg. if you decide to wake someone up or not). They can also switch onto different clocks to gain a new perspective and move around the space. 
						</p>
						<p>
							But during playtest we noticed that player often missed crucial decision points. So in order to keep this being a laid back experience, and to fit the theme, we designed this mechanic where player can freely go back and forth in time. This not only allows them to revisit past dialogues that they might have missed, but also intentionally go back to decision points and try a different action. 
						</p>
						<p>
							What's really special about this particular rewinding system is that, since the player is attached to a clock, if the clock gets moved over time, the player moves with it. So if a customer comes in, who has a watch on his wrist, the player can then possess the watch and rewind, to see where this customer came from. This opens up a huge possibility space for design as the player will be able to travel through both time and space with this one mechanic, but it also means we need to be very careful with our scope. We ended up not exploring this direction too much, but it's definitely worth revisiting in the future.

						<p>
							Very early on we've decided to use the controller as the input, since the joysticks resemble the feeling of turning clock hands. But the challenge that come with it was to figure out an accurate algorithm to switch between highlighted clocks on the screen. Usually there are multiple clocks scattered on different parts of the screen, and as the player pushes the left joystick to any direction, it should switch to the most reasonable clock.
						</p>
						<p>
							The solution I arrived at was to use a process similar to ray-marching. The idea is to first sort all the visible clocks on the screen by their screen-space distance to the current clock. Then, iterate through the list and shoot a ray from the current clock towards the direction of the joystick push, by a distance that is equal to the screen-space distance between this clock and our current clock, say D. Then, from the end point of this ray, check if any clock is within the radius of D. If so, pick the closest one; if not, move on to the next clock in the list. If we couldn't find one, it will just stay on the current clock.
						</p>
						<img src="imgs/thesecondhand_4.png">
						<p>
							The other part that was tricky is how to handle branching narrative that is rewindable. For all the character animations and animation sequences, they are implemented through an event-based system with a tree structure, that keeps track of all the decisions made and animations that has been triggered so far. When the player chooses to rewind, it backtracks and plays all animations in reverse order with a negative speed. This minimizes data storage and ensures perfect rewinding that can be triggered and stopped at any point.
						</p>
						<p>
							The other part is to do the same with subtitles. It didn't really make sense to handle subtitles like animations, so we build a separate system to handle reading from excel, parsing, and playing character-by-character so that they can be rewinded smoothly.

					<p>This is more of a retro, since it's one of those games where the emergent behaviors just completely overwhelmed my intentions, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about them...
Initially, under the prompt "cement", I wanted to create a shared graveyard experience where players silently and anonymously walk alongside each other and, when they're ready, press space to die and leave a message on their grave. Other players will then be able to read them, and because it takes time to travel back to where they died, they'll be more careful and thoughtful with the messages they leave.</p>
						<p>But that's totally not how the game is being played. In fact, players are interacting with it in much, much more expressive, heartwarming, and heartbreaking ways.</p>
						<p>Because of the asynchronous nature of the graveyard, it has become a social place where players write messages - not always for each other, some for themselves - and leave. it's become a place where they make jokes, say hellos, complain about life, and more. it exists in a weird middleground between saying what they normally wouldn't say, and writing what they normally wouldn't write online. it might be due to the anonymity, or the dying theme, or just the fact that it's a videogame.</p>
						<p>Reading the messages people leave has now become part of my daily routine. it's my version of twitter, but even more depressing, since they actually mean what they say, or at least it appears so. i'm happy for the person who said "things are finally going well", feel for those who're going through depression, and glad to see an lgbtqia+ corner taking form.</p>
						<p>But it's also a weird feeling because I didn't mean to provide this safe space. i'm seeing people that need help but i can't help them; i'm hearing voices that should be heard by more but they're not; i want to know who they are, but i can't and maybe shouldn't. It's such a weird feeling to be behind all of this.</p>
						<p>Something fun that is worth mentioning is since i didn't want a border for the yard, players are allowed to walk into the darkness. It was expected that players might try to find peace in a quieter, less crowded place, but it has sort of turned into a mysterious mission thing where some would hide messages and leave hints for others to find. probably one of the more interesting and evocative gameplay that happened.</p>

					<p>I love google sheets. </p>
					<p>Prototyping networking games is always a headache, but this time I found something that worked surprisingly well, and has been used in some other games by my friends.</p>
					<p>Essentially it's using google sheets as a database and server, and web requests from unity to read and write data to the sheet. by "server" it means we can put formulas that parse and organize the data sent to it and store them in separate sheets to make them easier to retrieve. The only caveat is I had to use google form for writing data which gets sent to a spreadsheet anyways, because of an api update google did earlier.

						This was made on a Monday night during final's week. I wanted to capture the feeling of wanting to take a break so badly yet couldn't because of all the work, and instead of making players feel the same pressure, I decided to make a game that would calm myself and others who might be in a similar situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The constraint I gave myself was it had to be short, so that I can finish it in 3 hours before bed and players can play in a minute.
					</p>
					<p>
						It started with the simple idea of prompting the players to turn their heads left and right by rotating the texts they need to read. A similar thought then emerged that is to have the player stretch their fingers by holding q and p at the same time. I had to prevent them from using both hands so an additional mouse button was added.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game could continue to be a sequence of these types of relaxing exercises but to me the physical break is not as important as a mental break, so I decided to ask the player to close their eyes and think about someone they love, which is something I do quite a lot. There are two concerns here: 1. I won't be able to tell if the player actually closes their eyes, and especially 2. if they find this section too cheesy. For me, the first one isn't really a huge problem but it does get awkward if they finish thinking and open their eyes and see that 30 seconds haven't passed. So what I did was to show that they have 30 seconds, but the internal timer to move on to the next section is actually around 15. This makes it faster to get through for those who find it cheesy, and for those who actually close their eyes and spend some time they wouldn't notice anything anyways.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was gonna end here but it felt too warm and wholesome to be a place to ask them "now go back to work". so the final activity was introduced. It came from the idea of letting yourself out with what's bothering you. but in my mind the act of thinking about why i'm not happy and the courage to type them out are more than enough. So while the game asks the player to type out why they're not happy today, the text that actually appears are just different face emojis. it's enough for them to know why they're not happy. they don't need to read it again. The emojis are also there to lighten the mood and make it a light-hearted conclusion to the short but much needed break.

						Nothing special since it was really simple and short. however it does make me wanna try making more of these extremely short ones. So I've been wondering if there are better and more efficient ways to approach them. As part of my practice I always try not to keep a comprehensive codebase/toolset, since reimplementation helps me to notice if something can be done differently, which I may not have thought of otherwise. but for these really short thought experiments it might be valuable to have a prototyping kit of some sorts. not sure.

					<p>
						The concept is born from the theme "roll of the dice". It was immediately obvious to us that none of us wanted to make another puzzle/strategy game, not because they're boring (although most of the time, yes), but because there're way too many out there already. Another big reason we landed on the horror theme was that none of us played much horror games, let alone made one, so naturally we had to take on the challenge.</p>
					<p>
						The intention is if we situate the player inside a dice in first person and they can only see the outside through the number holes, they will need to be more aware of the surroundings since there are many blind spots. As much as it's an interesting concept, it also poses quite a few difficult design challenges. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The one we spent the most time on was that the player simply, well, can't see. The balance between claustrophobic feeling and navigation was a constant challenge we battled throughout the design process. On one hand it was crucial to immerse the player in darkness and a sense of danger, on the other hand it's also meant to be a walking simulator that has a goal to reach. We iterated on the level many, many times based on playtest data to make the level easier to navigate, with intentional lighting and more guided prop placements. The end result is nowhere near perfect, but the learnings were immense.
					</p>
					<p>
						In retrospect, we should have been more careful with the use of verticality in our levels, due to the huge emphasis on a sense of scale. When the player is already quite tiny in relation to the environment (i.e a dice in a room) and can't see well, even the most basic platforming like "getting up there" or "crossing this bridge" is inherently quite challenging.

					This week's prompt was "Non-human Perspective". The class I TAed for was doing their Visual Novel assignment so I thought I'd do one myself too. The perspective I chose is from the 'computer', more specifically a compiler. It was very weird trying to think from a compiler's pov and imagine what their world feels like, and then situate the player, who can't think as rigorious as a machine, in its place. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I think towards the end I got to something interesting. Definitely one to revisit in the future.
